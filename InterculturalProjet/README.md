1. Address Book –

2. Picture Gallery – The Gallery application is an essential tool for managing and enhancing photos with ease.
   It allows users to store, organize, and edit images effortlessly, providing features like resizing, filtering, and
   compression for optimal customization.
   Designed for seamless interaction, Gallery integrates directly with Address Book, enabling users to assign profile

   making personal connections more visual and engaging. Whether preserving memories, enhancing images, or linking
   photos to contacts,
   Gallery delivers an intuitive and connected experience within the smartphone ecosystem.

4. Investify – Investify is an application that helps users manage their stock portfolios with comprehensive data.
   Integrated with the AlphaVantage API, Investify allows you to search for stocks, view real-time stock prices,
   and organize your holdings with ease. You can also set up recurrent investments to your portfolio.
