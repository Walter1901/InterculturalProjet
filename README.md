## Our Project in a Nutshell

### The project recreates a smartphone experience in Java, offering four practical applications that are ready to use.

1. Address Book – The Address Book app makes it easy to store, manage, and organize your contacts.
   Add multiple phone numbers, emails, addresses, and notes per contact with a clean, intuitive interface.
   Integrated with a built-in map, it lets you view and locate saved addresses directly.

2. Picture Gallery – The Gallery application is an essential tool for managing and enhancing photos with ease.
   It allows users to store, organize, and edit images effortlessly, providing features like resizing, filtering, and
   compression for optimal customization.
   Designed for seamless interaction, Gallery integrates directly with Address Book, enabling users to assign profile
   pictures to their contacts,
   making personal connections more visual and engaging. Whether preserving memories, enhancing images, or linking
   photos to contacts,
   Gallery delivers an intuitive and connected experience within the smartphone ecosystem.

3. Finance Tracker –  The Finance Tracker App offers a comprehensive solution for managing your personal finances on the go.
   Easily track income and expenses, set and monitor saving goals, and manage your investments—all within one app.
   Supports multi-currency input with live conversion to help you budget globally.
   With intuitive panels for expenses, savings, and investments, it helps you stay organized and make informed financial decisions.

4. Investify – Investify is an application that helps users manage their stock portfolios with comprehensive data.
   Integrated with the AlphaVantage API, Investify allows you to search for stocks, view real-time stock prices,
   and organize your holdings with ease. You can also set up recurrent investments to your portfolio.

## How to Build our Project

**1. Install the JDK (Java Development Kit)**\
Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

**2. Download the Project .jar File**\
Save the .jar file of the application you want to run onto your computer.

**3. Open the Application with "Java(TM) Platform SE Binary"**\
Right-click the .jar file.
Select "Open with" > "Java(TM) Platform SE Binary".
(Optional) To make this the default: check "Always use this app to open .jar files".

**application-specific instructions:**

**Picture Gallery:**
To use the Picture Gallery, you'll need an API key from [Tinify](https://tinify.com/developers). The key is free of charge
but limited to 500 queries per month. Once the limit is exceeded, the image compression feature will no longer be functional.
